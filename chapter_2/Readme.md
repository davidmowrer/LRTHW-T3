Can you find a key combo in RubyMine to comment out a line of code?
>   Command a to select a section of code and command / to comment out the lines of
>   code you selected.  It adds a # space to the beginning of each line.


Extra Credit:

Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you 
know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
>    Correct nothing is printed after the # pound sign.  Only line 7 would have 
>    printed out if it was not commented out as it had a puts.  The other lines
>    would have created an error.

Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backward. Start at the last 
line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.

Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
>    Found no errors.

Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name.
