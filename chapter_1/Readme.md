Task 1:  Verify that your Rubocop guard output has no errors, fix them if needed.
Add comments on how you fixed them.
Did you fix the string or did you tell Rubocop to ignor these code violations?

    I would change double quotes to single quotes where ever possible.  The first
    five strings can be changed to a single. 
 
Extra Credit:

Make your script print another line.

    Added another line puts 'Print another line.'

Make your script print only one of the lines.
  command a to select all, command / to put a # space at the beginning of each
  line selected.  This comments out all the lines 1-8.  Remove the # space on
  line 8, now only line 8 will print.
 
Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? 
Try to find out what this character does.
> It comments out the line of code, it it's no longer excutable.
