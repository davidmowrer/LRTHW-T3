>  I used variable that were associated with a colors to make a funny statement
   about the colors of his eyes, hair and teeth.  Also added to the previous
   statement about is teeth being usually white, to add that they were brown 
   depending on the amount of coffee he drank.  Kind of like the mad lib exercise
   output.  Not the correct use of variables, but does show if you actually mixed
   them up you could get an unusual statement.
   Also added some new variable to calculate his current age in 2014 as we knew he
   was 35 in 2009.

4) Make these changes in my_ex5.rb
